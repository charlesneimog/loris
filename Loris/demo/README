This directory contains a demonstration of sound morphing
using Python and the Loris library. To run this demo, you 
must have Python in your path, and the Loris module in your
PYTHONPATH. 

	make demo
	
runs the demo, 

	make refs
	
untars the reference files (to compare with those generated
by running the demo, they should sound very similar).

	make all
	
does both of the above.

Loris is an Open Source C++ class library implementing analysis, 
manipulation, and synthesis of digitized sounds using the 
Reassigned Bandwidth-Enhanced Additive Sound Model, developed by 
Kelly Fitz and Lippold Haken at the CERL Sound Group. For more

Additive Sound Model, please visit
