<P>
	An Analyzer represents a configuration of parameters for
	performing Reassigned Bandwidth-Enhanced Additive Analysis
	of sampled waveforms. This analysis process yields a collection 
	of Partials, each having a trio of synchronous, non-uniformly-
	sampled breakpoint envelopes representing the time-varying 
	frequency, amplitude, and noisiness of a single bandwidth-
	enhanced sinusoid. <p>

	For more information about Reassigned Bandwidth-Enhanced 
	Analysis and the Reassigned Bandwidth-Enhanced Additive Sound 
	Model, refer to the Loris website: 
	<a href="http://www.cerlsoundgroup.org/Loris/" 
	name="Loris web site">www.cerlsoundgroup.org/Loris/</a><p>
	
	In C++, Analyzer is Loris::Analyzer, defined in Analyzer.h.

<HR><H2>4. SampleVector object interface</H2></A>
<P>
	A SampleVector represents a vector of floating point samples of
	an audio waveform. In Loris, the samples are assumed to have 
	values on the range (-1., 1.) (though this is not enforced or 
	checked).

<P><TT><B>sampleVector_getLength( const SampleVector * vec )</B></TT>

</BLOCKQUOTE>

<P><TT><B>sampleVector_setLength( SampleVector * vec, unsigned long size )</B></TT>
<BLOCKQUOTE>[ returns void  ]
<BR>  	Change the number of samples represented by this SampleVector. If

<HR><H2>5. Non-object-based procedures and utility functions.</H2></A>
<P>
	Operations in Loris that need not be accessed though object
	interfaces are represented as simple functions.
<P><TT><B>channelize( PartialList * partials, 
				 BreakpointEnvelope * refFreqEnvelope, int refLabel )</B></TT>
<BLOCKQUOTE>[ returns void  ]
<BR>  	Label Partials in a PartialList with the integer nearest to
	the amplitude-weighted average ratio of their frequency envelope
	to a reference frequency envelope. The frequency spectrum is 
	partitioned into non-overlapping channels whose time-varying 
	center frequencies track the reference frequency envelope. 
	The reference label indicates which channel's center frequency
	is exactly equal to the reference envelope frequency, and other
	channels' center frequencies are multiples of the reference 
	envelope frequency divided by the reference label. Each Partial 
	in the PartialList is labeled with the number of the channel
	that best fits its frequency envelope. The quality of the fit
	is evaluated at the breakpoints in the Partial envelope and
	weighted by the amplitude at each breakpoint, so that high-
	amplitude breakpoints contribute more to the channel decision.
	Partials are labeled, but otherwise unmodified. In particular, 
	their frequencies are not modified in any way.
   
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<P><TT><B>copyByLabel( const PartialList * src, long label, PartialList * dst )</B></TT>
<BLOCKQUOTE>[ returns void  ]

							   long numSamps )</B></TT>
<BLOCKQUOTE>[ returns BreakpointEnvelope *  ]
<BR>  Return a newly-constructed BreakpointEnvelope by sampling the 
	frequency envelope of the longest Partial in a PartialList. 
	Only Partials whose frequency at the Partial's loudest (highest 
	amplitude) breakpoint is within the given frequency range are 
	considered. The envelope will have the specified number of samples.
	If the specified number of samples is 0, then the
	longest Partial's frequency envelope is sampled every 30 ms
	(No fewer than 10 samples are used, so the sampling maybe more
	dense for very short Partials.) <p>
	
	For very simple sounds, this frequency reference may be a 
	good first approximation to a reference envelope for
	channelization (see channelize()).<p>
	
	Clients are responsible for disposing of the newly-constructed 
	BreakpointEnvelope.
   
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<P><TT><B>dilate( PartialList * partials, 
			 double * initial, double * target, int npts )</B></TT>
<BLOCKQUOTE>[ returns void  ]
<BR>  	Dilate Partials in a PartialList according to the given 
	initial and target time points. Partial envelopes are 
	stretched and compressed so that temporal features at
	the initial time points are aligned with the final time
	points. Time points are sorted, so Partial envelopes are 
	are only stretched and compressed, but breakpoints are not
	reordered. Duplicate time points are allowed. There must be
	the same number of initial and target time points.<p>
	
	The time points are passed as strings; convert any native
	collection to a string representation, numerical elements
	will be extracted, other characters will be ignored.
   
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<P><TT><B>distill( PartialList * partials )</B></TT>
<BLOCKQUOTE>[ returns void  ]
<BR>  	Distill labeled (channelized)  Partials in a PartialList into a 
	PartialList containing a single (labeled) Partial per label. 
	The distilled PartialList will contain as many Partials as
	there were non-zero labels in the original PartialList. Unlabeled 
	(label 0) Partials are eliminated.
   
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<P><TT><B>exportAiff( const char * path, const SampleVector * vec,

<BLOCKQUOTE>[ returns void  ]
<BR>  	Export audio samples stored in a SampleVector to an AIFF file
	having the specified number of channels and sample rate at the 
	given file path (or name). The floating point samples in the 
	SampleVector are clamped to the range (-1.,1.) and converted 
	to integers having bitsPerSamp bits.
   
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<P><TT><B>exportSdif( const char * path, PartialList * partials )</B></TT>
<BLOCKQUOTE>[ returns void  ]
<BR>  	Export Partials in a PartialList to a SDIF file at the specified
	file path (or name). SDIF data is described by RBEM and RBEL 
	matrices. 
	For more information about SDIF, see the SDIF web site at:

</BLOCKQUOTE>

<P><TT><B>exportSpc( const char * path, PartialList * partials, double midiPitch, 
				int enhanced, double endApproachTime )</B></TT>
<BLOCKQUOTE>[ returns void  ]
<BR>  	Export Partials in a PartialList to a Spc file at the specified file
	path (or name). The fractional MIDI pitch must be specified. The 
	enhanced parameter defaults to true (for bandwidth-enhanced spc files), 
	but can be specified false for pure-sines spc files. The endApproachTime 
	parameter is in seconds. A nonzero endApproachTime indicates that the plist does 
	not include a release, but rather ends in a static spectrum corresponding 
	to the final breakpoint values of the partials. The endApproachTime
	specifies how long before the end of the sound the amplitude, frequency, 
	and bandwidth values are to be modified to make a gradual transition to 
	the static spectrum.   
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<P><TT><B>importAiff( const char * path, SampleVector * vec, 
				 double * samplerate, int * nchannels )</B></TT>
<BLOCKQUOTE>[ returns void  ]
<BR>  	Import audio samples stored in an AIFF file at the given file
	path (or name). The samples are converted to floating point 
	values on the range (-1.,1.) and stored in the given 
	SampleVector, which is resized to (exactly) accomodate all the 
	samples from in the file. If samplerate is not a NULL pointer, 
	then, on return, it points to the value of the sample rate (in
	Hz) of the AIFF samples. Similarly, if nchannels is not a NULL
	pointer, then, on return, it points to the value of the number
	of channels of audio data represented by the AIFF samples.
   
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<P><TT><B>importSdif( const char * path, PartialList * partials )</B></TT>
<BLOCKQUOTE>[ returns void  ]
<BR>  	Import Partials from an SDIF file at the given file path (or

<BLOCKQUOTE>[ returns void  ]
<BR>  	Morph labeled Partials in two PartialLists according to the
	given frequency, amplitude, and bandwidth (noisiness) morphing
	envelopes, and append the morphed Partials to the destination 
	PartialList. Loris morphs Partials by interpolating frequency,
	amplitude, and bandwidth envelopes of corresponding Partials in 
	the source PartialLists. For more information about the Loris
	morphing algorithm, see the Loris website:

<BLOCKQUOTE>[ returns void  ]
<BR>  	Shift the pitch of all Partials in a PartialList according to

	units of cents (1/100 of a halfstep).
   
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<P><TT><B>synthesize( const PartialList * partials,

				 double srate )</B></TT>
<BLOCKQUOTE>[ returns void  ]
<BR>  	Synthesize Partials in a PartialList at the given sample
	rate, and store the (floating point) samples in a SampleVector.
	The SampleVector is resized, if necessary, to hold as many
	samples as are needed for the complete synthesis of all the
	Partials in the PartialList. The SampleVector is not 
	cleared before synthesis, so newly synthesized samples are
	added to any previously computed samples in the SampleVector.
   
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<P><TT><B>sift( PartialList * partials )</B></TT>
<BLOCKQUOTE>[ returns void  ]
<BR>    Eliminate overlapping Partials having the same label
    (except zero). If any two partials with same label
    overlap in time, keep only the longer of the two.
    Set the label of the shorter duration partial to zero.
