<H3>1.1. class AiffFile</H3></A>
	An AiffFile represents a sample file (on disk) in the Audio Interchange
	File Format. The file is read from disk and the samples stored in memory
	upon construction of an AiffFile instance. The samples are accessed by 
	the samples() method, which converts them to double precision floats and
	returns them in a SampleVector.

<H3>1.2. class Analyzer</H3></A>
	An Analyzer represents a configuration of parameters for
	performing Reassigned Bandwidth-Enhanced Additive Analysis
	of sampled waveforms. This analysis process yields a collection 
	of Partials, each having a trio of synchronous, non-uniformly-
	sampled breakpoint envelopes representing the time-varying 
	frequency, amplitude, and noisiness of a single bandwidth-
	enhanced sinusoid. <p>

	A PartialIterator represents an iterator on a Partial.<p>
	
	PartialIterators can only be obtained from their subject 
	Partial, through the begin and end methods of Partial,

	PartialIterators are used to access individual Breakpoints
	in Partial Breakpoint envelopes, and the times of those 
	Breakpoints.<p>
	
	PartialIterators are valid only as long as their subject
	Partial exists. In languages with some form of grabage 
	collection, this means that a reference to the Partial 
	must be maintained in order to iterate. If that reference is
	lost, the Partial will be deleted, and the iterators will
	refer to free memory. By extension, if the Partial is an
	element of a PartialList, a reference to the PartialList
	must be maintained.<p>
	
	PartialIterators are also invalidated when the Breakpoint 
	they reference is erased from the Partial. Erasure does not 
	invalidate any other PartialIterators, refering to other

<P><TT><B>channelize(partials,refFreqEnvelope,refLabel)</B></TT>
<BLOCKQUOTE>  	Label Partials in a PartialList with the integer nearest to
		the amplitude-weighted average ratio of their frequency envelope
		to a reference frequency envelope. The frequency spectrum is 
		partitioned into non-overlapping channels whose time-varying 
		center frequencies track the reference frequency envelope. 
		The reference label indicates which channel's center frequency
		is exactly equal to the reference envelope frequency, and other
		channels' center frequencies are multiples of the reference 
		envelope frequency divided by the reference label. Each Partial 
		in the PartialList is labeled with the number of the channel
		that best fits its frequency envelope. The quality of the fit
		is evaluated at the breakpoints in the Partial envelope and
		weighted by the amplitude at each breakpoint, so that high-
		amplitude breakpoints contribute more to the channel decision.
		Partials are labeled, but otherwise unmodified. In particular, 
		their frequencies are not modified in any way.

<P><TT><B>createFreqReference(partials,minFreq,maxFreq,numSamples)</B></TT>
<BLOCKQUOTE>  	Return a newly-constructed BreakpointEnvelope by sampling the 
	frequency envelope of the longest Partial in a PartialList. 
	Only Partials whose frequency at the Partial's loudest (highest 
	amplitude) breakpoint is within the given frequency range are 
	considered. <p>
	
	If the number of sample points is not specified, then the
	longest Partial's frequency envelope is sampled every 30 ms
	(No fewer than 10 samples are used, so the sampling maybe more
	dense for very short Partials.) <p>
	
	For very simple sounds, this frequency reference may be a 
	good first approximation to a reference envelope for
	channelization (see channelize()).
   
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<P><TT><B>dilate(partials,initial_times,target_times)</B></TT>
<BLOCKQUOTE>  	Dilate Partials in a PartialList according to the given 
		initial and target time points. Partial envelopes are 
		stretched and compressed so that temporal features at
		the initial time points are aligned with the final time
		points. Time points are sorted, so Partial envelopes are 
		are only stretched and compressed, but breakpoints are not
		reordered. Duplicate time points are allowed. There must be
		the same number of initial and target time points.<p>
		
		The time points are passed as strings; convert any native
		collection to a string representation, numerical elements
		will be extracted, other characters will be ignored.

<P><TT><B>distill(partials)</B></TT>
<BLOCKQUOTE>  	Distill labeled (channelized)  Partials in a PartialList into a 
	PartialList containing a single (labeled) Partial per label. 
	The distilled PartialList will contain as many Partials as
	there were non-zero labels (non-empty channels)
	in the original PartialList. Additionally, unlabeled (label 0) Partials are 
	"collated" into groups of temporally non-overlapping Partials,
	assigned an unused label, and fused into a single Partial per
	group.

<P><TT><B>exportSpc(path,partials,midiPitch,enhanced,endApproachTime)</B></TT>
<BLOCKQUOTE>  	Export Partials in a PartialList to a Spc file at the specified file
		path (or name). The fractional MIDI pitch must be specified. The optional
		enhanced parameter defaults to true (for bandwidth-enhanced spc files), 
		but can be specified false for pure-sines spc files. The optional 
		endApproachTime parameter is in seconds; its default value is zero (and 
		has no effect). A nonzero endApproachTime indicates that the PartialList does 
		not include a release, but rather ends in a static spectrum corresponding 
		to the final breakpoint values of the partials. The endApproachTime
		specifies how long before the end of the sound the amplitude, frequency, 
		and bandwidth values are to be modified to make a gradual transition to 
		the static spectrum.
