The Loris C++ sources are _mostly_ documented using Doxygen. If you
have doxygen installed, then html documentation will be
generated in the build process. They are not installed however,
you can install them in any convenient location.

"make pdf" builds a pdf version of the C++ documentation.

The Csound opcodes are documented in opcodes.html.

Documentation for the Python module is available using pydoc.

The procedural (C) interface is documented only in the
header file loris.h.
