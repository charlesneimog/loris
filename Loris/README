Welcome to Loris.

Loris is an open source C++ class library implementing analysis,
manipulation, and synthesis of digitized sounds using the Reassigned
Bandwidth-Enhanced Additive Sound Model.

For more information about Loris and the Reassigned Bandwidth-Enhanced
Additive Model, contact the developers at loris@cersloundgroup.org, or
visit them at http://www.cerlsoundgroup.org/Loris/.

The primary distribution point for Loris is SourceForge
(http://loris.sourceforge.net) and its mirrors.

Loris is free software. Please see the file COPYING for details.

For documentation, please see the files in the doc subdirectory.

For a list of major changes to Loris, organized by release number,
please see the file NEWS.

INSTALLATION: 

For generic configuration and installation instructions, see
the file INSTALL.

In order to compile and link the Loris library and scripting
extensions, you will need the FFTW Fourier transform routines,
available at www.fftw.org. FFTW is covered by its own 
license and copyright, and is entirely separate from Loris.

Loris no longer has any dependency on the IRCAM SDIF library.

MacOS INSTALLATION:

Loris can be built using the standard GNU tools from a Terminal window
under Mac OS X (Darwin), follow the instructions for the standard 
distribution. All compatibility issues that caused poor performance 
or failure of the standard configuration and build tools under 
Darwin have (long since) been resolved (except that the Tcl
module fails to load under MacOS 10.2). You will, of course, need
the developers' tools, available from Apple, in order to compile
Loris (or anything else) under Darwin. It is also possible to
build Loris using CodeWarrior or ProjectBuilder under OS X. 

Loris can also be built for older versions of the Mac OS, but 
owing to the difficulty of maintaining the project files for 
new releases of the CodeWarrior development environment, we are
no longer attempting to distribute those project files in any
form. Users wanting to build Loris using CodeWarrior can simply
drag the source files in the classes and pi directories into
a new project along with appropriate versions of the SDIF and
FFTW libraries (available from their respecitve websites). 
Users wanting to build an extension for MacPython should 
follow the directions for building MacPython extensions using
CodeWarrior, using loris_python_wrap.C from the scripting
directory to build the module, loriscmodule.shlib, or something 
similar (the suffix convention differs depending on the version
of MacPython), and loris.py from the scripting directory as the 
interface to the C module.
