This is Loris 1.0beta3.

Loris is an Open Source C++ class library implementing analysis,
manipulation, and synthesis of digitized sounds using the Reassigned
Bandwidth-Enhanced Additive Sound Model. Loris supports modified
resynthesis and manipulations of the model data, such as time- and
frequency-scale modification and sound morphing. Loris includes
support and wrapper code for building extension modules for various
scripting languages (Python, Tcl, Perl).

Loris is developed by Kelly Fitz and Lippold Haken at the CERL Sound
Group (http://www.cerlsoundgroup.org), with contributions from Paul
Christensen. IEEE floating point conversion code was provided by
Malcolm Slaney and Ken Turkowski. Reference-counted "smart pointer"
code provided by Vladimir Batov.

For more information about Loris and the Reassigned Bandwidth-Enhanced
Additive Model, contact the developers at loris@cersloundgroup.org, or
visit them at http://www.cerlsoundgroup.org/Loris/.

The primary distribution point for Loris is SourceForge
(http://loris.sourceforge.net) and its mirrors.

INSTALLATION: 

In order to compile and link the Loris library and scripting
extensions, you will need the FFTW Fourier transform routines,
available at www.fftw.org, and the SDIF (Sound Description
Interchange Format) data formatting routines, available at
www.ircam.fr/sdif. FFTW and SDIF are covered by their own 
licenses and copyrights, and are entirely separate from Loris.

Loris Makefiles and projects look for the FFTW and SDIF headers and
libraries on their default installed locations (/usr/local/include and
/usr/local/lib, respectively,  on UNIX systems). You may need to
change your Makefiles or projects if you install these packages in
some other configuration.

SDIF:

Loris supports a bandwidth-enhanced version of the SDIF 1TRC format
that is described in the SdifTypes.STYP file in Loris/lib. Until this 
matrix format becomes part of the SDIF standard (real soon now), it
is necessary to replace the SdifTypes.STYP file in the standard 
distribution with the file in Loris/lib, or to set the SDIFTYPES 
environment variable, as described in the tutorial material on the
IRCAM SDIF website (www.ircam.fr/sdif). 

Loris currently uses version 3.2.2 of the SDIF library. This version 
is incompatible with the version 3.2.0 (used by previous releases of 
Loris), and there is no way to detect at compile-time which version 
of the SDIF library (and header, sdif.h) is being included. Loris, 
therefore, assumes that version 3.2.2 is being used unless the flag
SDIF_VERSION is set to 320, in which case version 3.2.0 is assumed. 
We anticipate a better solution in the near future.

COMPATIBILITY:

Loris has been tested on various UNIX systems using gcc-2.95.2 and
MacOS 9.x using Metrowerks Codewarrior Pro 5.3 and 6.0. It has also
reportedly been built using Cygwin, a gcc port for Windows
(http://sources.redhat.com/cygwin/). It should compile with any
reasonably standard-compliant compiler.

The Loris module for Python has been tested using Python 1.5.2 and 2.0,
and is also reported to work with Python 1.6. Loris is configured to 
build a Python 2.0 module, for other Python releases, the Makefile (or 
MacOS Codewarrior project) will need slight modifications.

The CodeWarrior project for MacOS requires version 5.3 (5.0 plus all
updates). It has also been verified to work with version 6.0.

MAJOR CHANGES:

change since 1.0beta2 release:

- preliminary implementation of PartialList iteration and access to
individual Partials in a PartialList in the scripting interface. This
implementation is incomplete and experimental, and should be expected
to change.

- AiffFile class added to scripting interface, so there is no longer a
separate function (and disk access) for querying the sample rate, bit
depth, and number of channels in a samples file. These parameters are
now obtained from an AiffFile object that also provides access to the
SampleVector.

- Sieve class has been added to Loris class library, invoked through
sift() function in the scripting interface. The sifting operation is
an experimental process that sometimes improves the fidelity of morphs
and syntheses from distilled PartialLists. Sifting is performed after
channelization and before distillation, and has the effect of
relabeling some Partials to zero (0). These Partials are left behind
unmodified by the distillation process, and can be removed from the
PartialList, or retained and synthesized. (Partials labeled zero do
not participate in morphing, they are instead faded in and out.) This
implementation is experimental and should be expected to change.

- errors in test and demo scripts have been fixed.

- Python interface documentation has been updated and improved.

- updated to use the version 3.2.2 of the SDIF library from IRCAM,
obtain from the IRCAM SDIF website (www.ircam.fr/sdif). This version
is incompatible with version 3.2.0, used in by earlier Loris releases.
Update to version 3.2.2, or compile with the flag SDIF_VERSION defined
to have the value 320 to use version 3.2.0 of the SDIF library. See
the README file or more information.

- SWIG 1.3a5 is being used to generate the Python wrappers now, so
anyone wishing to try generating wrappers for other languages can now
choose from Java, Guile, Ruby, and others, in addition to Tcl and Perl.

- other minor changes in the scripting interface, see the demo and
test scripts for examples. 

change since 1.0beta1 release:

- added .spc file support for real-time bandwidth-enhanced additive
synthesis and sound morphing using the Symbolic Sound Kyma System.
Documentation updated accordingly (though not very extensive).

- Loris module tested and verified with Python 2.0, now the default
build (to build or another Python release, change the Makefile, or,
in the MacOS Codewarrior project, the Access Path, to reflect the 
correct version number).

- static library target added to Codewarrior project for MacOS.

- MacOS Python module now uses a static library instead of a shared 
libarary (DLL), since static libraries seem much more stable and are
less restrictive. (This should alleviate some instability related to
memory management across library boundaries.)

- test directory has been added with the simple morph test, distinct
from the longer test in the demo directory (and package).

changes since 1.0alpha release:

- the core Loris library is mostly unchanged from the alpha release,
but the scripting interface has been completely rewritten to provide
a generic interface to a variety of scriping languages using SWIG
(www.swig.org) At this time, only the Python module has been
tested, and only with Python 1.5.2, though Loris is also reported to
work with Python 1.6.

- a c-linkable procedural interface has been implemented.

- a first-cut of (html) documentation for the procedural interface and
for the Python module is included, and posted to SourceForge
(sourceforge.net/projects/loris).
