Welcome to Loris.

Loris is an open source C++ class library implementing analysis,
manipulation, and synthesis of digitized sounds using the Reassigned
Bandwidth-Enhanced Additive Sound Model.

For more information about Loris and the Reassigned Bandwidth-Enhanced
Additive Model, contact the developers at loris@cersloundgroup.org, or
visit them at http://www.cerlsoundgroup.org/Loris/.

The primary distribution point for Loris is SourceForge
(http://loris.sourceforge.net) and its mirrors.

Loris is free software. Please see the file COPYING for details.

For documentation, please see the files in the doc subdirectory.

For a list of major changes to Loris, organized by release number,
please see the file NEWS.

INSTALLATION: 

For generic configuration and installation instructions, see
the file INSTALL.

For Macintosh-specific configuration and installation instructions,
see the file README-MAC.

In order to compile and link the Loris library and scripting
extensions, you will need the FFTW Fourier transform routines,
available at www.fftw.org, and IRCAM's SDIF (Sound Description
Interchange Format) data formatting routines, available at
www.ircam.fr/sdif. FFTW and SDIF are covered by their own 
licenses and copyrights, and are entirely separate from Loris.

Loris supports a reassigned bandwidth-enhanced version of the 
SDIF 1TRC format that is not handled correctly by versions 
of IRCAM's SDIF library earlier than 3.4. Please download 
release 3.4 or later.
