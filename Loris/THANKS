Loris THANKS file

Loris is developed by Kelly Fitz and Lippold Haken at the CERL Sound
Group (http://www.cerlsoundgroup.org), with contributions from Paul
Christensen. 

IEEE floating point conversion code was provided by Malcolm Slaney 
and Ken Turkowski, by way of Arun Chandra. 

Reference-counted "smart pointer" code provided by Vladimir Batov.

Key parts of the development of Loris were initiated during an invited
residency by Kelly Fitz at the Bregman Electronic Music Studio at
Dartmouth College in 1996, graciously arranged by Larry Polansky.
