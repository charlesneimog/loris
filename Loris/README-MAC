Welcome to Loris.

Loris is an open source C++ class library implementing analysis,
manipulation, and synthesis of digitized sounds using the Reassigned
Bandwidth-Enhanced Additive Sound Model.

This file contains specific information for building and installing
Loris for the Macintosh. Please read the file README for general
information about Loris.

INSTALLATION:

A Metrowerks Codewarrior project for building Loris under MacOS is
distributed as an exported XML file (Loris.mcp.xml) in the mac
subdirectory. This file can be used to build a CodeWarrior project for
any recent version of the IDE, using the Import Project option on the
File menu.

In order to compile and link the Loris library and scripting extensions,
you will need the FFTW Fourier transform routines, available at
www.fftw.org, and the SDIF (Sound Description Interchange Format) data
formatting routines, available at www.ircam.fr/sdif. FFTW and SDIF are
covered by their own licenses and copyrights, and are entirely separate
from Loris.

FFTW:

The CodeWarrior project for MacOS links the FFTW routines as a shared
library, FFTW.PPC.shlb. This library can be built from a CodeWarrior
project imported from the file FFTW.mcp.xml. You may wish to adjust the
Code Generation settings to build a library optimized for your
processor. You may also want to build a slightly smaller version of the
library with the SIOUX libraries (remove MSL SIOUX.PPC.Lib and replace
it with the file console.stubs.c, which is part of MSL), since Loris
does not need a console-enabled version of the FFTW library (the test
suites, described below, do need the console-enabled version). You will
also need to drag a copy of the shared library (FFTW.PPC.shlb) to the
Extensions folder so that it can be found at runtime.

Both CodeWarrior projects search for the fftw--2.1.3 folder at the same
level as the System folder. If you put it somewhere else, you will have
to change the Access Paths for your project.

Alternatively, you can download Greg Allen's MacFFTW package from the
link on the FFTW Installation page, or
http://www.arlut.utexas.edu/~allen/MacFFTW-2.1.3.sit, and build an FFTW
library from those projects, or simply use the precompiled libraries
provided with MacFFTW. Remove FFTW.PPC.shlb from the Loris project and
add your prefered FFTW library to the Loris library target in the Loris
project.

BEWARE: The fftw package includes a suite of tests that can be run to
verify the output of transforms of various lengths. The FFTW project
included with Loris (as FFTW.mcp.xml) and Greg Allen's projects include
targets to compile and run these test suites. Some versions of the
CodeWarrior compiler have optimizers that cause the FFTW routines to
fail the test suites. The errors are small, maybe insignificant, but if
you want valid FFTW library, the options are a) use Greg Allen's
libraries included in the MacFFTW distribution (do (NOT) use his
projects to recompile the libraries), b) compile your FFTW library on
another architecture on which the tests are passed, or c) experiment
with turning off various optimizations until the tests are passed.

SDIF: 

IRCAM's SDIF library is provided in binary form for MacOS (Classic), and
can be installed by simply putting the library in the Extensions folder,
and the header somewhere that CodeWarrior can find it. The CodeWarrior
project searches for the SDIF 3.4 binary distribution folder at the same
level as the Codewarrior folder. If you put it somewhere else, you will
have to change the Access Paths for your project. Please use version 3.4
or later of IRCAM's SDIF library, problems in earlier versions of the
library prevented Loris from working correctly.

Darwin/MacOS X:

Loris does not perform well under Darwin/MacOS X. For unknown reasons,
the FFTW library runs very slowly under Darwin. Also, dynamically loaded
libraries (like the scripting modules) are different and incompatible
under Darwin. We are working on solutions for these problems.
