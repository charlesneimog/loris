Adding bweoscil to Csound:

in entry[1 2].c:


#include "bweoscil.h"  //must be included in list of included libraries as top of file


void bwes(void*);


and


void bwei(void*); //must be added to the list of function definitions found after the #include statements


{"bweoscil",  S(BWE),      5,    "a",    "kSkkko",    bwei,     NULL,    bwes    },  //has to be added to the end of thelist of similar statements


in Makefile:


COBJCORB = bweoscil.o //must be added to the list of objects to be make

(maybe also add to list of sources?)


bweoscil.h //must be added to the list of header files to include in the make


also (kel) add loris to include and lib lines

also, add a rule for compiling cpp files
.C.o:
	$(CXX) $(CFLAGS) -c $*.c


note: our stuff requires a recent version of Csound (newer than 4.17 that has deinit
field in OPDS (added 2002-10-26, according to ChangeLog).

Also, need one (recent) that doesn't remove everything from cs.h when __cpluscplus is defined.

FINALLY got this to build with version 4.18.
