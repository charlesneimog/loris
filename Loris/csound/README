Adding lorisgens to Csound:

in entry[1 2].c:


#include "lorisgens.h"  
must be included in list of included libraries as top of file


void lorisplay_setup(void*);
void lorisplay(void*);

must be added to the list of function definitions found after the #include statements


{"lorisplay",  S(LORISPLAY), 5, "a",    "kSkkko", lorisplay_setup, NULL, lorisplay },  
has to be added to the end of thelist of similar statements


in Makefile:
LORISSRC = lorisgens.C

add $(LORISSRC) to list of sources CSRCS

LORISOBJ = lorisgens.o

add $(LORISOBJ) to list of objects COBJS


add lorisgens.h to list of headers HDRS


also (kel) add loris to include and lib lines

also, add a rule for compiling cpp files
.C.o:
	$(CXX) $(CFLAGS) -c $*.c


note: our stuff requires a recent version of Csound (newer than 4.17 that has deinit
field in OPDS (added 2002-10-26, according to ChangeLog).

Also, need one (recent) that doesn't remove everything from cs.h when __cpluscplus is defined.

FINALLY got this to build with version 4.18.
