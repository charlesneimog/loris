To build Fossa, you need to follow these steps:
1. Install Loris [www.sourceforge.net/projects/loris]
2. Install QT 3.3 [www.trolltech.com]
3. Run ./reconf
4. Run ./configure --with-loris=[path to Loris] --with-qt=[path to QT]
5. Run make


There is currently no make install. You just run Fossa from where you build it.
